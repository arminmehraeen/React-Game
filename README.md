### **Rock Paper Scissors Game (React, Tailwind CSS)**

This project is a simple yet interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **React** for front-end interactivity and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive UI design. The game features a classic implementation of the popular Rock Paper Scissors game, where the user competes against the computer.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Three Pages**:
   - **Menu Page**: The landing page with a start button to initiate the game.
   - **Game Page**: The player selects between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly chooses its option.
   - **Result Page**: Displays the result (win, lose, or tie) and provides an option to play again.

2. **Stylish UI**:
   - Full-screen background images are used on all pages, creating an immersive game environment.
   - Glassmorphic cards for displaying content (game choices and results) give a modern look and feel.
   - Interactive buttons with hover animations and smooth transitions improve the overall user experience.

3. **Icons for Choices**:
   - Instead of plain text, the game page uses attractive icons (via `react-icons`) to represent Rock, Paper, and Scissors, providing visual clarity.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The app is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.

5. **Automatic Navigation**:
   - The menu page automatically navigates to the game page after a brief delay, enhancing the flow of the game.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- **React**: For building reusable UI components and handling state.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation between the menu, game, and result pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and efficient styling with a focus on responsiveness and modern design elements.
- **React Icons**: For displaying intuitive and stylish icons representing the game choices.

#### **How It Works**:
- Players choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors on the game page.
- The computer randomly selects its own choice.
- The result page shows whether the player wins, loses, or ties based on the selections, with an option to replay.

This project demonstrates the power of combining **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to create a simple, visually appealing, and interactive game.
